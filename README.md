# smallpt_rs
A re-implementation of Kevin Beason's global illumination renderer.

I had some fun re-implementing the original code found on [Kevin Beason's own homepage](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/).
As I'm writing this, I've never written any code generating 3D graphics before, so this was a fun start.
[These explanatory slides](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8g97JkuSSBwUENiWTJXeGtTOHFmSm51UC01YWtCZw) are a good reference
to understand what's going on (referring to the original code).

Cheers!
